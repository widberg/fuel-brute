# fuel-brute
CRC32 Brute Force Solver For FUEL

<sup>This repository is a relative of the main [FMTK repository](https://github.com/widberg/fmtk).</sup>

## Notice

This project is a reverse engineering playground for crc32 algorithms more than it is a set of tools.

## Files

### dictc

Generate a dictionary file from a text document.

A dictionary file contains information about legal sequences of characters that may appear in a target string.

### hashc

Generate hash file from a text document.

A hash file contains information about target crc32s.

### coagulate

Transpose the output from cpu or cuda back into a human readable text format.

### cpu

Cpu middle end.

### cuda

Cuda middle end.
